Welcome to the fourth week of the course. Up to this point we've talked
at a very skills level. In week one, we talked about to use
Python to interact with and process data. In week two,
we introduced the pandas library and tabular data in the form of Series and
DataFrames. In week three, we deepened our
knowledge how to use pandas by grouping data, applying functions, and
merging data sets. In week four of the course, we want to
introduce the course project, which will test your ability to use the skills
you developed in weeks one through three. The goal of this project is to help
you not only practice those skills but to start building up a portfolio of
real world data science problems, which you can use to demonstrate your
ability to acquire, manipulate, clean, and run basic data analyses. Before we get to the project though, I
want to put fresh in your mind a few core statistics concepts that will help ground
your further studies in data science. And keep in mind that this isn't a full-on
statistics course by any means, so I would encourage you to check out the
many statistics learning options on this platform and others.
